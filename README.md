# LIZ-Challenge

This repository contains code to complete the following challenge:

Imagine we are a really funny company. Our business goal is to provide jokes as a smartphone widget.
We are buying the newest jokes from our partner. So we have to request them every minute from their web service. The frontend will be created by an agency, but the backend will be provided by us.
And that's what you have to do. We can tell jokes but are technically noob's.

This is your challenge:

    -create a python application (use every framework, library etc. you like or think it make sense)
    -request a joke every minute from https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/
    -store the result in a proper way and structure
    -commit your runable code on a repository
    -document and test your application
    -think about how we can deploy and host the application

There is no wrong solution as long as it works and you can explain why you did it.
Happy coding x)

to start the application run the following commands in your command line:

> set FLASK_APP=root
> set FLASK_ENV=development
> flask run
